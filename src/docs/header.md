# Introduction

The documentation about the example RESTful APIs.

## Setup

To run the APIs, two things are required: `x-api-key` (to authenticate AWS API gateway, which then accesss the lambda function), and `x-api-token` (a unique company-based token stored in the database, used to authenticate the company-level access)
